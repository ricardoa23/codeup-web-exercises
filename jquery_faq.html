    <h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yellowstone encompasses 3,472 square miles (2,221,766 acres) which makes
        it larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are more than 10,000 hydrothermal features in Yellowstone. The
        four types of thermal features are geysers, hot springs, mud pots, and
        fumaroles.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yellowstone is home to more than 500 active geysers (more than half the
        world’s geysers).
      </li>
      <li>
        Yellowstone Lake has 131.7 sq. miles of surface area and 141 miles of
        shoreline. It is the largest high elevation lake in North America.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Zion National Park</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The word “Zion” comes from ancient Hebrew. The first Anglo-European
        settlers, Mormon pioneers, arrived in the area in the late 1800s. They
        named the area Zion, which is ancient Hebrew for sanctuary or refuge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zion National Park used to have a different name. Before Zion National
        Park was called Zion, it was a monument known as the Mukuntuweap
        National Monument and was first protected in 1909 by President William
        Howard Taft. After 10 years, the park expanded and was renamed Zion. It
        now covers 229 square miles of spectacular red rock landscape. The name
        change came as many believed that Spanish and Native American names
        would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a
        place, might not visit.
      </li>
      <li>
        It was home to an ancient civilisation. The Anasazi were the original
        occupants of Zion Canyon, a civilisation that thrived around 1,500 B.C..
        You can find traces of their magnificent sandstone villages, network of
        roads and rock art throughout the park today.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Zion Canyon was carved over millions of years by the Virgin River
        and is approximately 2,000 feet deep. There are many hiking
        opportunities along its floor in the 20 to 30 foot wide area known as
        The Narrows.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Yosemite National Park</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yosemite might be our nation’s 3rd national park, but it sparked the
        idea of national parks. Twenty-six years before it was a national park,
        President Lincoln signed the Yosemite Land Grant on June 30, 1864,
        protecting the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley. It was the first time
        the government protected land because of its natural beauty so that
        people could enjoy it, and we’re still benefiting from their foresight
        today. Thanks to John Muir’s passionate writing to further protect the
        delicate ecosystem of the High Sierra, Yosemite later became a national
        park.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yosemite’s granite rock formations glow like fire at sunset. Sunlight
        plays amazing tricks at Yosemite -- illuminating El Capitan and Half
        Dome in brilliant reds and oranges. Horsetail Fall is famous for
        appearing to be on fire when it reflects the orange glow of sunset in
        mid- to late-February. It’s a spectacular sight reminiscent of
        Yosemite’s historic Firefall, which occurred nightly until 1968, when
        hotel operators would push campfire embers over Glacier Point to wow
        park goers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The park’s diverse landscape supports more than 400 species. While at
        Yosemite, look all around and you might spy one of the park’s many
        amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals looking back. One such animal is
        the rare Sierra Nevada red fox, which was spotted for the first time in
        nearly 100 years on a wildlife cam, roaming the high elevations of
        California’s Sierra Nevada.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yosemite is home to one of the tallest waterfalls in the world. At 2,425
        feet, Yosemite Falls is one of tallest on the planet, but did you know,
        it’s actually made up of three separate falls? Upper Yosemite Fall, the
        middle cascades and Lower Yosemite Fall makeup Yosemite Falls, which can
        be seen from numerous places around Yosemite Valley. Learn more about
        the other waterfalls at Yosemite.
